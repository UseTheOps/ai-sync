Great start on the VS Code extension! 

I think we should also include **skills, custom prompts & custom agents definitions** in the sync functionality.

Currently, the extension syncs:
- Directories: `.github/copilot/`, `copilot/`, `.copilot/`
- Files: `.copilotignore`, `copilot.{yaml,yml,json}`, `copilot-instructions.md`, `copilot.md`

**Suggested additions:**

1. **Custom Skills**
   - Directory: `.github/skills/`
   - Common patterns: `*.md`, `skill-*.yaml`

2. **Custom Prompts**
   - Directory: `.github/prompts/`
   - Patterns: `*.md`, `*.txt`, prompt configuration files

3. **Custom Agents**
   - Directory: `.github/copilot/agents/`
   - Patterns: `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, agent definition files

These are all part of the Copilot workspace configuration ecosystem and would be valuable to sync alongside the existing Copilot files for a complete AI development environment setup.

What do you think about expanding the scope to include these?
